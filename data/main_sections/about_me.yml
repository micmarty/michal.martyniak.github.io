title: About me

parts:
- |
  I'm a junior developer living in Northern Poland, having my Engineer's diploma project done.
  My attention is mainly focused on Deep Learning (ML in general), Ruby on Rails and leveling up my organizational skills.
  I consider myself as a person with wide tech landscape perspective, updating my knowledge day to day just for fun.

  Favourites: classy, jazz and soul music, podcasts, Linux (not popular distros included), buying/playing instruments and recording new tracks.

  Musical background: cello classes in music school as a kid, trombone practices in orchestra as a teenager.
  At some point I used to have 7 instruments at home, now it's only 4.
