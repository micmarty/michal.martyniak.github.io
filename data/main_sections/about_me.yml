  I'm a junior developer living in Northern Poland, having my Engineer's diploma project done.
  My attention is mainly focused on Deep Learning (ML in general), Ruby on Rails and leveling up my organizational skills.
  I consider myself as a person with wide tech landscape perspective, updating my knowledge day to day just for fun.
