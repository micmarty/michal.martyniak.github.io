title: About me

first_part: |
            I used to play 5 instruments at some point, now it's 3. Curious? Ask me then.
            Usually I play covers, mostly by my ear, without using chords from the Internet.
            Music I'm listening to is in my opinion 'tasty', e.g. Gypsy Jazz, Funky, Instrumental, Game soundtracks.
            Music kind isn't that important (Metal isn't any worse), but the atmosphere, artistic expression, lyrics and the story behind.
            I like to analyze it, mimic its sound, whistle or clap with my hands as if they were my drum sticks
            Right now when I have some free time to spend I record short songs and upload them to SoundCloud. 
            You can check out my profile here TODO. There's so much to learn about music production, Ableton, the hardware...

            Absolutely my greatest friend is Discovery Weekly from Spotify, and NPR Music. 
            Spotify and YouTube knows what I like so precisely! (privacy slained)

            Currently I'm studying Computer Science at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology, ETI.
