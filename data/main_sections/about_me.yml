title: About me

parts:
- |
  I'm a junior developer living in Northern Poland, 4 months to get an engineer's degree (hopefully).
  I'm mainly focused on Deep Learning (ML in general), Ruby on Rails and planning my nearest future.
  I consider myself as a person with wide tech landscape perspective, updating my knowledge day to day just for fun. 

- |
  I love: fancy music (e.g. Gypsy Jazz), podcasts, Linux (not popular distros included), buying/playing instruments and 
  recording new tracks.
  When I have some additional time to spend I go to IT meetups in Gda≈Ñsk, swimming pool or I just watch some TV series (currently my favourite one is Sillicon Valley).

  I also have musical background: cello classes in music school as a kid, trombone practices in orchestra as a teenager.
  At some point I used to have 7 instruments at home, now it's only 4.
