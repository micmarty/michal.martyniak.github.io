project_title: Using Librosa for audio signal analysis
short_description: |
  "I was doing some research about choosing best model for my neural network.
  The whole purpose was to try a library which transforms an audio track excerpt (huge array of samples) into an image.
  I still need to decide what to choose as input: images into Convolutional Neural Network or plain array of numbers"
