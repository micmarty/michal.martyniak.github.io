        We've just started making an open-source solution for distributed trainings in TensorFlow.
        It will:
        <ul>
          <li>Launch with a single command</li>
          <li>Have a dashboard built with Material Design components (Google Android style)
          <li>Communicate over ssh</li>
          <li>Monitor resources like: GPU, memory load, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        The project has started within <a href="http://gradient.eti.pg.gda.pl/" target="_blank"><img src="images/gradient_logo_small.png" style="margin-bottom: 0px"><b>GradientPG</b></a> (Student Research Group I participate in).

# 2. Librosa, Jupyter Notebook
second_project:
  project_title: |
                  Audio signal analysis in Python with Librosa 
                  <span class="label label-theme">machine learning</span> 
                  <span class="label label-theme">own research</span>
  short_description: |
                      I had to do some research about choosing the best model for my neural network.
                      My journey started with librosa - it can transform an audio excerpt into many visual representations, 
                      e.g. spectogram or chroma and has very useful features like beat detection.
