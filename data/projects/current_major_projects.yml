  project_title: Audio signal analysis in Python with Librosa
  short_description: |
                      I had to do some research about choosing the best model for my neural network.
                      My journey started with librosa - it can transform an audio excerpt into many visual representations, e.g. spectogram or chroma and 
                      has very useful features like beat detection.
