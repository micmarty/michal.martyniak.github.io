# Librosa, Jupyter Notebook
first_project:
  project_title: Audio signal analysis in Python with Librosa
  short_description: |
                      I had to do some research about choosing the best model for my neural network.
                      My journey started with librosa - it can transform an audio excerpt into many visual representations, e.g. spectogram or chroma and 
                      has very useful features like beat detection.

      One of my very first apps, but now I know what was wrong.
      There's not much Ruby, sadly - mostly vanilla JavaScript
    - |
      Next time I would pick:
      - TypeScript
      - Middleman -> static site generator
      - simple_form gem
      - Google Charts
      - Material Design + CSS Grid, not Bootstrap
