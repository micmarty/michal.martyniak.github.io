      It is capable of reading scancodes (keys), dealing with the text mode. 
      I was able to turn on paging, protected 64-bit mode and execute Rust unsafe code (which runs even on barebone metal, without kernel libraries obviously).
      There is generated ISO image, which is enough to run inside QEMU + debugger (like gdb).

      <b>I proud of it</b>, but for those, who haven't experienced writing own OS firsthand, it may look crappy and straightforward.
      Even my lecturer wasn't 100% sure if it's feasable in Rust <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>.

      One of my very first apps, but now I know <b>what was wrong</b>.
