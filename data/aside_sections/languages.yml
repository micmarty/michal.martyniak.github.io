              Comfortable while speaking, especially about tech.
              Reading or writing documentation without problems.
              I am constantly improving my accent by watching TV series and listening to podcasts.

              I used to be somewhere around B2/C1 but since I graduated my High School, didn't really have to use that skill.
              Reading is feasable, writing needs more focus, talking is very limiting right now.
